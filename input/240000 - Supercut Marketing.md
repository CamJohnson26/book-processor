Inaccuracies in WW2 movies:

Movie Mistake

In The Imitation Game (2014) Alan Turing writes a letter to Winston Churchill complaining about his team, specifically Hugh Alexander, and asking to run the department himself.

In reality, the entire team including Alexander signed onto the letter to Churchill, jointly asking for more resources for the team.

Fun fact:

Actually happened:

DONE
This actually happened...
In Into the Storm (2009), Winston Churchill suffers a mild heart attack after visiting the United States following Pearl Harbor. 

His doctor did give this diagnosis, and as shown in the movie the event was downplayed for political reasons, although a followup diagnosis suggested that it wasn't actually a heart attack.

Simple, Reasonable, Relevant, Personal

Hi all, please let me know if I'm breaking any rules as I'm new to this subreddit, and was very excited to find it since I have a project that fits in nicely here. I actually couldn't believe that other people have had similar ideas before as I thought this was fairly unique, but I guess the internet is a big place. 

The most similar projects I see are these 2, but the first one doesn't appear to be actively worked on. The second is much closer to what I was trying to do, but it looks like we have enough of a difference in approach that mine should still be valuable. First of all, my project covers more movies, but is much shorter. And also I've focused more on making the project educational than entertaining, so each clip has a title card associated with it with information about what event is depicted, where it is, etc. As a result my project jumps around a lot, but also helps to put all the events of World War II in context.

What is it?

I started the World War II Supercut purely for my own education, but slowly realized that others might benefit from watching it also. I was going through some famous World War II movies, and found myself wishing I could see them in chronological order. Some movies reference the same event, like Dunkirk, but it can be difficult to see how much time passes between battles, and I had trouble following the full story of the war. For example, I knew over a year passed between Dunkirk and the bombing at Pearl Harbor, but couldn't have told you what happened in between. In the same way I knew the war started with the invasion of Poland, but didn't know what preceded those events.

One year of obsessive research later and I'm happy to present the Supercut. I watched over 100 World War II films (some at 4x speed), pulled out the most impactful clips, researched what they represented and where they belonged on the timeline, and then edited ruthlessly until the entire cut could fit into 12 1 hour episodes. A lot of great content had to be cut, but I think the end result is much more effective and accessible as a result. The research was the most difficult part of the process, and I learned an insane amount from this. Sources were varied and included books, Wikipedia, primary sources, random internet articles, and anything else I could find.

Several amazing films and clips had to be cut in the interest of time. And the project has many flaws I would have liked to fix before releasing. But I hope viewers can forgive the lack of subtitles in the first 3 episodes, inconsistent video quality, and occasional errors on the title cards, and appreciate what I believe is a unique way to learn about World War II, in a way that focuses on individual people's lived experience, instead of a dry textbook description.

This has been a labor of love for over a year and I'm incredibly excited to share this with all of you. I'll be releasing 2 episodes a week for the next 6 weeks until all have been posted. Check my Twitter account for the latest information.

Here's the full list of episodes, along with the films showcased in each:




Why should you care?

How do you watch it?

Reddit Copy:
Hi! I'm excited to share the trailer for my long standing project to cut over 100 World War II movies together. I got the idea after watching Patton and Band of Brothers at similar times, and wanted a way to see how the events in both films were laid out chronologically and related to each other, and that quickly spiraled to wanting to see the entire war through the lens of popular movies.

The final project is almost done and will be 12 one hour episodes. I'm going to try to post a teaser on June 6 (D-Day 80th anniversary), and then will release the episodes in batches, probably starting in a few weeks.

I'm happy to answer any questions. Probably can't take many suggestions but would still be interested to hear them!

World War II Supercut - D-Day Teaser

As promised here https://www.reddit.com/r/fanedits/comments/1d8711a/trailer_world_war_ii_supercut_teaser_coming/, I'm releasing a preview of the World War II Supercut today in honor of the 80th anniversary of D-Day.

The World War II Supercut will be 12 one hour episodes. It's documentary style and stitches scenes from 100+ movies together chronologically. To make it more cohesive I have title cards on every clip so you know where it is, who's in the scene, and what's happening.

For the teaser, I took the Normandy scenes from the final project and cut down the runtime by half. It's 15 minutes so won't post it here, but message me for the link, or check out my socials.

The Supercut's main goal is to educate. If you want a more narrative cut with higher quality rips, checkout /u/subjectzer00's "And Not To Yield" project!

The Supercut is a 12 hour, 12 part, chronological cut of over 100 World War II movies. I've done my best to cover as many regions and events as possible, while still sticking to the aggressive time constraints. While it's not possible to cover every country or viewpoint, I think the finished cut is still a great way to learn about the overall flow of the war in an intuitive, holistic way that hasn't previously been available
By design, the Supercut jumps between regions and events, so every clip has a title card on it, saying where the clip is, what is the event, who are the characters, and what film is it from. This gives it a more "documentary" feel than the similar "And not to Yield" project that has already been posted. Also subtitles are included, which should help non native English speakers to follow what's happening.

Films in Episode 1:
Hitler: The Rise of Evil (2003)

World War II Supercut E6 - Midway

The Supercut has reached the half way point, episode 6 out of 12! And fittingly this week we're looking at the battle of Midway, and the biggest mistake Japan made in the entire war.

Watching this episode you'll understand the significance of this major battle, but also see how it fit in with the Holocaust, which enters a new phase of evil in this episode.

Other exciting scenes are the Doolittle raid, which is a story almost to good to be real, and an assassination attempt on one of the highest ranking Nazi officers.

Exciting episode this week, thanks to everyone who has watched and left comments, hope you enjoy!

Split it in 3: Overall, technical, and research

In September 2024 I released the final episode of the World War II Supercut, a project I've been working on off and on for over a year and a half. The idea was to stitch as many World War II movies as I could into a chronological "super movie", with scenes from various different movies showing what was happening in history in the order that it actually happened.

The final episode in the World War II Supercut, covering August 1945 - 2006. DM me directly for the link, or the previous links should work as well. I'm also on Twitter under /u/ww2supercut.


Massive thanks to everyone who has watched an episode and shared your experience with the project. My goal has been to create an entertaining, accessible way to learn about the war, and I'm truly thankful for everyone who has given their time to checking it out. For those who don't know, the Supercut is a 12 hour, 12 part, chronological cut of over 100 World War II movies. This final episode completes the project, and all 12 episodes are now available to watch.

I'll release a blog post next week describing the process of building it, so be on the lookout for that. I'm hoping to inspire more educational cuts like this for other periods of history, excited to see what comes next.
